## Project description

Used plotly and d3 to grab json data and load it dynamically on a website.  Set it up to automatically populate with the first user, then dynamically change when you use the dropdown menu, so that the user demographic information, top 10 bacterias (bar chart), and bubble chart of all the user's bacteria in size with hover text shows up.
